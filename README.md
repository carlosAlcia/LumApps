# Image Classifier with UI using PyTorch and CIFAR10

This program allows to train and test a Convolutional Neural Network. Using the CIFAR10 dataset, you can classify images into 10 different classes:

 - Airplanes
 - Cars
 - Birds
 - Cats
 - Deer
 - Dogs
 - Frogs
 - Horses
 - Ships
 - Trucks

The UI allows to load images from files or directly from the clipboard, and to show the predicted class with the confidence.
